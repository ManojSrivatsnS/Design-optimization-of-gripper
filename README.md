#Design optimization of pneumatically actuated gripper using GRA-Taguchi Method

The optimization is solved by creating the required goals as objective functions. The mathematical modeling of the objectives are required to carry out the optimization. 

The objective functions are the primary model to carry out the problem statement; however, the solution needs to be endorsed logically.

Validation functions are necessary to verify the accuracy and the sensitivity of the objective functions and dynamic modeling. 

The Statistical analysis is executed post normalization based on the considered condition for each objective and validation function.
