#Design optimization of pneumatically actuated gripper using GRA-Taguchi Method

The optimization is solved by creating the required goals as objective functions. The mathematical modeling of the objectives are required to carry out the optimization. 

The objective functions are the primary model to carry out the problem statement; however, the solution needs to be endorsed logically.

Validation functions are necessary to verify the accuracy and the sensitivity of the objective functions and dynamic modeling. 

The Statistical analysis is executed post normalization based on the considered condition for each objective and validation function.
 
First a mathematical model based on the Gripping force and Gripper width should be constructed interms of the force transmission along the links of the gripper; This can be created as function in MAtlab, so it can be called anytime we need to verify the simulation of objective fucntions;

Run the mathematical model as a function and use stack pointer to execute the function based on the statistically deduced range for each link.

Estimate the data distribution and carry out statistical analysis to deduce the optimal solution post statistical approach.
