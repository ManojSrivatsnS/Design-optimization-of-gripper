# Design-optimization-of-gripper
Pivotal application of Grippers has rendered their performance to be efficacious, in addition to the congruous application. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model for a three-jaw gripper, to procure the fundamental design parameters that are crucial for the consideration of design constraints. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated based on the considered design variables and constraints, which is solved to optimally obtain the dimensions of the links and dimensions of the actuating cylinder. To incorporate precision over the position of the gripper, abreast higher gripping force, statistical analysis has been adopted, solving for optimal link dimensions. By including manipulator displacement and calculating corresponding gripping force, the problem is made more real-time, that can address existing or any future gripper simulations alike. Compromised solution based on objective function formulation is applied and the obtained optimal solution is used to design three-fingered, pneumatically actuated gripper.
