1.The multiple performance analysis can be conducted with the computation of deviation from the standard values and then finding the grey relational co-efficient for the generated data-sheet.

2. normalization is carried out based on the requirement between the normalizing principles of 
    I) higher the better
    II) Lower is better
    III) optimum the best
    
3.The signal to noise ratio is computed which again has three different calculation conditions

C_i (n)=[(τ_i (k)-min⁡(τ_i (k)))/(max⁡(τ_i (k))-min⁡(τ_i (k)) )];	
where,  
𝜏𝑖(𝑘) = 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑎𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑦 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛;  
Max𝜏𝑖(𝑘) = 𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑘𝑡ℎ 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟;   
Min𝜏𝑖(𝑘) = 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑘𝑡ℎ 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒r; 

4. Deviation is calculated based on the signal-noise ratio generated. This eliminates the variance there by deducing the maximum probable force and gripper jaw width by statistical approach.

μ_i=[(∆_min-φ⁡(∆_max ))/( ⁡(∆_i (k))-φ⁡(∆_max ) )];			
Where, 
∆𝑚𝑎𝑥= ⋁𝑗∈𝑖 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ||𝑥0(𝑘) − 𝑥𝑗(𝑘)||;  
∆𝑚𝑖𝑛= ⋁𝑗∈𝑖 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ||𝑥0(𝑘) − 𝑥𝑗(𝑘)||;  
∆𝑚𝑖𝑛= ||𝑥0(𝑘) − 𝑥𝑗(𝑘)||; 

5. 	the average of the grey relational coefficient for each of the parameter. 
ϑ_i=∑_(k=1)^n▒〖μ_i (k)〗				 
For n = number of performance characteristics 

The best probable solution is selected based on the statistical conditions and analyis
